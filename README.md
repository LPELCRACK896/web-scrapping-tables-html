# How to run the programm?
The script that you should run is main.py, but you wont be able to run it just with repository as it is, because I ignored a private file called constant.py just in case the actual owner of the site gets mad about this programm. If anyway you want to run the programm, you better contact with me in my email: luispedev@gmail.com
